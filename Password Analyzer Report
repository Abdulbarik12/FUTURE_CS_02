Password Analyzer Report

Introduction:
The Password Analyzer tool is designed to evaluate the strength of user-entered passwords based on predefined security criteria. The tool provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for users to check their password strength and receive a score-based evaluation.

Algorithm Explanation:
The password strength evaluation algorithm assesses passwords based on five key factors:

Length Criteria – Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.

Uppercase Letters – Presence of at least one uppercase letter.

Lowercase Letters – Presence of at least one lowercase letter.

Digits – Presence of at least one numerical digit.

Special Characters – Presence of at least one special character (e.g., @, $, !, %, *, ?, &).

Each factor contributes to the password score, which ranges from 0 to 10:

If a password meets a criterion, it earns 2 points.

The total score determines the password strength:

0-4: Weak

5-8: Moderate

9-10: Strong

Effectiveness:
This scoring method ensures that passwords meeting all essential security criteria are classified as strong. The combination of multiple factors makes it difficult for attackers to guess or brute-force passwords. Additionally, the GUI-based interface allows users to quickly analyze and improve their passwords in a user-friendly manner.

Conclusion:
The Password Analyzer tool provides a robust and efficient method for evaluating password strength. It encourages users to create stronger passwords by highlighting areas for improvement, ultimately enhancing overall cybersecurity.
