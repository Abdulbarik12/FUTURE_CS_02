Password Strength Analyzer Report üîê

Introduction:
The Password Strength Analyzer is a simple yet powerful tool built using Python (Tkinter, Regex, and Hashlib). This tool helps users evaluate the strength of their passwords and provides encryption using SHA-256.

Features: üõ°Ô∏è
‚úÖ Password Strength Analysis (Weak, Moderate, Strong, Very Strong)
‚úÖ Checks for Common Weak Passwords
‚úÖ Ensures Use of Uppercase, Numbers & Special Characters
‚úÖ Encrypts Passwords with SHA-256
‚úÖ User-friendly GUI with Tkinter

Algorithm Explanation:
The password strength evaluation algorithm assesses passwords based on five key factors:

Length Criteria ‚Äì Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.

Uppercase Letters ‚Äì Presence of at least one uppercase letter.

Lowercase Letters ‚Äì Presence of at least one lowercase letter.

Digits ‚Äì Presence of at least one numerical digit.

Special Characters ‚Äì Presence of at least one special character (e.g., @, $, !, %, *, ?, &).

Common Weak Passwords Check ‚Äì The tool compares the input password against a list of commonly used weak passwords.

Encryption ‚Äì Passwords are securely hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm for added security.

Each factor contributes to the password score, which ranges from 0 to 10:

If a password meets a criterion, it earns 2 points.

The total score determines the password strength:

0-4: Weak

5-6: Moderate

7-8: Strong

9-10: Very Strong

Effectiveness:
This scoring method ensures that passwords meeting all essential security criteria are classified as strong or very strong. The combination of multiple factors makes it difficult for attackers to guess or brute-force passwords. Additionally, the SHA-256 encryption provides an extra layer of security by hashing the passwords, preventing direct exposure. The GUI-based interface allows users to quickly analyze and improve their passwords in a user-friendly manner.

Conclusion:
The Password Strength Analyzer tool provides a robust and efficient method for evaluating password strength. It encourages users to create stronger passwords by highlighting areas for improvement while ensuring additional security through SHA-256 encryption, ultimately enhancing overall cybersecurity.
